# **wireless**
## Bt_root
METHODS: <br/>
•	Open the chall.pcapng file in Wireshark and examine the packet <br/>
•	Identify the protocol used for data exchange by using online resources <br/>
•	Then we can identify that the protocol is obex then by applying filter to packets we can isolate only obex packets <br/>
•	By going through the filtered data we can identify the hidden message embedded within an information field <br/>
•	By googling that message we will get a name <br/>
•	Then we open the file, flag translator and run it on python and enter the name(harald blutooth) we got earlier  then the flag is displayed <br/>
WHAT I LEARNT: <br/>
•	Obex is protocol which is used for transferring data over bluetooth <br/>
•	learned to identify and know the functions of  the network protocols used in the packets in wireshark <br/>
•	analyzed network traffic for hidden information
